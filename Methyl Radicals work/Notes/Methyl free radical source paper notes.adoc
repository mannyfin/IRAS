= A methyl free radical source for use in surface studies

- Produced via azomethane pyrolysis in a tubular reactor in UHV yielding CH~3~ radicals (42%), CH~4~, ethane, N~2~, and
H~2~

- Under UHV conditions collisions are negligible -> reducing the probability of secondary chain reactions

Design::
Ta wire tightly wound around capillary tube and alumina cement covering wires for thermal contact and formation of atomic
H on wires.

A Type K TC used to measure temp ~1300 K with H@ 10A current through the Ta

P~base~ ~10^-8^ Torr, measured using Faraday mode of QMS. 70 eV ionization energy

Main mass cracks: 15, 43, 58 (parent mass), 28
Other mass cracks: 12, 13, 14, 26, 27, 29, 30, 41, 42, 56, 57

To do: normalize m/z = 15 with other mass cracks with Table I, and remove contribution from any methane produced.

Near complete conversion at 1173 K, but do not operate at too high T due to wall reactions more prominent
