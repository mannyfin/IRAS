## Below are some short notes on some papers

### Vibrational Characterization of Thiophene Decomposition on the Mo(100) surface
- Thiophene is a 5 membered ring with sulfur. Think furan, but with S instead of O.
- saturation coverage = 0.3 ML
- low coverage, only H~2~ desorption


### Determination of surface sites for hydrogen chemisorption over Mo(100) single crystal surfaces by using LEED, TDS and HREELS
- H~2~ coverage on Mo(100) is 2.0 ML
- H~2~ binds to two fold bridge sites, evidenced by LEED, and HREELS, and TPD
