CO abs coverage on Pt(100) was θ = 0.77 +/- 0.03

Surface atom density of Pt(100), ρ~Pt(100)~ is 1.503 * 0.866 = 1.302 e 15 atoms/cm^2^

1.302x10^15^ atoms/cm^2^ * 0.77 = 1E15 molecules of CO/cm^2^

Saturation Area from our TPD: 0.318 relative to 1 ML CO area: `sat_CO_area = 2253432`

So 0.318*1E15 = 3.18E14 molecules of CO / cm^2^

3.18E14/1.302E15 = 0.244 ML of CO relative to surface atomic density, ρ~Pt(100)~

So we have a minimum of 0.122 ML of GUA decomposing because GUA can either form 1 or 2 CO plus O~(ads)~ on the surface
If it forms 1 CO then it is 0.122 ML of GUA decomposing minimum and the maximum is above 0.244 ML of CO
