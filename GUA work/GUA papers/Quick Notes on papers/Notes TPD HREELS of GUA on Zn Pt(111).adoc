= TPD and HREELS of GUA on Zn/Pt(111)

Prior work::
    - Benzaldehyde and anisole on Pt(111) and Zn/Pt(111)
    - Zn alters d-band of Pt by decreasing binding of ring to surface.

Experimental::
    - Assume 1ML of Zn = 1 ML of Pt = 1.51E15 atoms/cm^2
    - Prior: Zn stays on surface below 600 K. Above, it diffuses to substitutional alloy in primarily in second layer
    - This work, stick with Zn adatoms
    - TPD of guaiacol--> low T peak is second layer. Saturation dose of 0.5 L -> only chemisorbed GUA

Results::
    ::: _TPD of GUA on Pt(111):_
    ** Peak at pass:q[<u>225 K assigned to desorption of *second physisorbed layer* </u>]  *(see ref 20).*
    ** Only other desorbing species were H~2~ and CO
    *** assume that all the oxygen in GUA is accounted for in CO
    ** H~2~ has a desorption limited peak @ 340 K -> dehydrogenation occurred below that temperature
    ** H~2~ and CO have coincident peak at 435 K -> from some adsorbed intermediate
