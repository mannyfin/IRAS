This file contains information about our data

After plotting the uptake of GUA, we believe we have 1 ML of GUA at an exposure of 0.015 L.
This is based on the saturation of the recombinative peak around 320 K. We slope subtracted the peak to determine areas.
This is also corroborated with the CO and H2 uptake areas.

Between 191 K and 249 K, we observe the following:
-Disappearance of the hydrogen bonded OH stretch peak at 3400 cm-1
-Disappearance of ring C-H stretch from 3000-3100 suggests ring is lying flat or C-H has decomposed, prob lying flat
because we see ring modes at 1508 cm-1
-Presence of C-H asym and sym stretches from 2800-3000 suggest methyl group is intact
-bending CCO o.o.p mode suggests R-O is intact.
-No OH stretch at 3500 cm-1 suggests scission of the hydroxyl hydrogen
-TPD results indicate recombination of this hydrogen to make guaiacol and H2
-small decrease in intensity of in plane modes (919, 961, 1027) relative to:
    out of plane CCO bending mode at 748 cm-1,
    A' CX stretch at 1268 cm-1
    and the other out of plane modes

Between 249 K and 337 K, we observe the following:
On the surface (adsorbed species) we have: H, CO, CH3, OCH3 ,formaldehyde, hydroxyl-H removed GUA, phenol, and benzene.

-Appearance of CO stretch on atop (2012 cm-1) and bridge (1813 cm-1) sites implying that if OCH3 decomposes to form H(ads)

-1043 cm-1 disappears, so we cleave the O-CH3 bond leaving CH3(ads) on the surface. This CH3 recombines with H to form
CH4, or undergoes decomposition to form H(ads) and C(ads), and the H(ads) recombine to form H2 (maybe at higher temps.)
-1232 cm-1 disappearance attributed to scission of the C-OCH3 bond leads to formation of formaldehyde and phenol. The
formaldehyde can either undergo decomposition to form surface H and CO, or desorb later as formaldehyde.
The phenol exists because of the 748 cm-1 bending mode and desorbs at 390 K. The formaldehyde could be a crack of 29.
- Sometimes we get additional scission of the C-OH bond based on 1268 cm-1 C-OH stretch to form some benzene.
