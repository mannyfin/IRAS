This file contains information about our data

After plotting the uptake of GUA, we believe we have 1 ML of GUA at an exposure of 0.015 L.
This is based on the saturation of the recombinative peak around 320 K. We slope subtracted the peak to determine areas.
This is also corroborated with the CO and H2 uptake areas.
