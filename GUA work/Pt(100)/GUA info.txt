This file contains information about our data

After plotting the uptake of GUA, we believe we have 1 ML of GUA at an exposure of 0.015 L.
This is based on the saturation of the recombinative peak around 320 K. We slope subtracted the peak to determine areas.
This is also corroborated with the CO and H2 uptake areas.

Between 191K and 249 K, we observe the following:
-Disappearance of the hydrogen bonded OH stretch peak at 3400 cm-1
-Disappearance of ring C-H stretch from 3000-3100 suggests ring is lying flat or C-H has decomposed
-Presence of C-H asym and sym stretches from 2800-3000 suggest methyl group
