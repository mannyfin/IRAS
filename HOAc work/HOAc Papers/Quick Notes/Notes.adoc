= Notes for acetic acid paper

Facts::

- Surface atom density of Ni(110), œÅ~Ni(110)~ is 1.864 * 0.612 = 1.141 e 15 atoms/cm^2^

- Saturation CO coverage:

- Saturation H2 coverage:

Need to correct for background pressure

arr = [1.5, 1.8, 1, 2.5, 3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 4.9, 6.3, 7.6, 9.1]
L = 1e-6

Some easy questions

- Do we have H2, CO, and possibly H2O saturation on Ni(110)? Yes
- What are the values for their respective coverages?
